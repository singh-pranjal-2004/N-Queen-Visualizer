### Introduction
The N-Queens problem is a classic puzzle of placing N chess queens on an NxN chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. This project provides a visual representation of how the solution is found using a recursive backtracking algorithm.

### Features
- Interactive visualization of the N-Queens problem.
- Adjustable board size (from 4x4 up to 20x20).
- Real-time speed controller for visualization.
- Dark/Light mode toggle for better visibility.
- Display of all solutions found after visualization completes.
